## 1.2 mkfs

- Description: This command is used to format a disk into a file system. 
- Options:
   - `-u`: (Optional) specifies the maximum number of writable hosts to which the file system can be mounted. Default value: 3. Maximum value: 255. 
   - `-f`: (Optional) enables forced formatting. 
- Example:

```bash
# Format the nvme1n1 disk into a file system.
# The -C disk option specifies that the disk that you want to format is a local disk. In this example, the name of the local disk is nvme1n1. 
$sudo pfs -C disk mkfs nvme1n1

# If the system returns the "already formatted" message, check that the mkfs command is run in a ready environment. Then, add the -f option following the mkfs command.
$sudo pfs -C disk mkfs -f nvme1n1

# Format the nvme1n1 disk into a file system. In this example, the file system can be mounted to a maximum of 10 writable hosts.
$sudo pfs -C disk mkfs -u 10 nvme1n1
```

## 1.3 growfs

- Description: This command is used to format the chunks that are added after a storage capacity expansion. The IDs of the chunks that need to be formatted are within the [-o, -n) interval.
- Options:
   - `-o`: specifies the number of chunks before the storage capacity expansion. 
   - `-n`: specifies the number of chunks after the storage capacity expansion. 
   - `-f`: (Optional) enables forced formatting. 
- Examples:

```bash
# Format the chunks that are added to the nvme1n1 disk after the storage capacity of the disk is expanded from 10 GB to 30 GB. In this example, the IDs of the chunks are within the [1, 3) interval.
$sudo pfs -C disk growfs -o 1 -n 3 nvme1n1

# If the system returns the "already formatted" message, check that the growfs command is run in a safe environment. Then, add the -f option following the growfs command.
$sudo pfs -C disk growfs -o 1 -n 3 -f nvme1n1
```

## 1.4 info

- Description: This command is used to query the metadata of the file system on a disk. 
   - The number of directory levels whose metadata you want to query is fixed to 1 and cannot be changed. 
- Examples:

```bash
# Query the metadata of the file system on the nvme1n1 disk.
$sudo pfs -C disk info nvme1n1
Blktag Info:
 (0)allocnode: id 0, shift 0, nchild=3, nall 7680, nfree 1897, next 0
Direntry Info:
 (0)allocnode: id 0, shift 0, nchild=3, nall 6144, nfree 5974, next 0
Inode Info:
 (0)allocnode: id 0, shift 0, nchild=3, nall 6144, nfree 5974, next 0
# The nchild parameter indicates the number of chunks in the file system. The total storage space of the disk is equal to 10 GB multiplied by the value of the nchild parameter. In this example, the total storage space of the nvme1n1 disk is 30 GB.
# The storage capacity of idle blocks on the disk is equal to 4 MB multiplied by 1,897.
```

| map | Queries the index table of the blocks that store the data of a file. | `-o`: specifies the offset of the file. | None. |

### 2.4.2 touch

- Description: This command is used to create a file on a disk. If the file that you want to create has been created, the system returns a failure message. 
- Options: None.
- Examples:

```bash
# Create a file named myfile in the mydir directory of the nvme1n1 disk.
$sudo pfs -C disk touch /nvme1n1/mydir/myfile
```

### 2.4.3 write

- Description: This command is used to write the data that is read from standard input streams to a file. You can specify the offset at which the system starts to write data and the number of bytes that you want to write to the file. 
   - If you do not specify an offset, the system starts at the header of the file to write data. 
   - If you specify an offset but do not specify the number of bytes that you want to write, the system starts at the specified offset to write all data that is read from standard input streams. 
   - If you do not specify an offset or the number of bytes that you want to write, the system starts at the header of the file to write all data that is read from standard input streams. 
- Options:
   - `-o`: (Optional) specifies the offset at which the system starts to write data to the file. Default value: 0. 
   - `-l`: (Optional) specifies the number of bytes that you want to write to the file. If you do not configure this option, the system writes all data that is read from standard input streams to the file. 
- Examples:

```bash
# Write three bytes starting at an offset of 2. In this example, 012 is written to the file that you specify.
$sudo echo "012345" | pfs -C disk write -o 2 -l 3 /nvme1n1/mydir/myfile
```

### 2.4.4 read

- Description: This command is used to read data from a file. You can specify the offset from which the system starts to read data and the number of bytes that you want to read from the file. 
   - If you do not specify an offset, the system starts at the header of the file to read data. 
   - If you specify an offset but do not specify the number of bytes that you want to read, the system reads data starting at the offset to the end of the file. 
   - If you do not specify an offset or the number of bytes that you want to read, the system reads all data of the file. 
- Options:
   - `-o`: (Optional) specifies the offset at which the system starts to read data from the file. Default value: 0. 
   - `-l`: (Optional) specifies the number of bytes that you want to read from the file. 
- Examples:

```bash
# Read 10 bytes starting at an offset of 2.
$sudo pfs -C disk read -o 2 -l 10 /nvme1n1/mydir/myfile

```

### 2.4.5 truncate

- Description: This command is used to resize a file. After you resize a file, no new physical blocks are assigned to the file until data is written to fill the increased size of the file. 
- Options:
   - `-l`: specifies the new size of the file. 
- Examples:

```bash
# Change the size of the myfile file to 100 MB.
$sudo pfs -C disk truncate -l 104857600 /nvme1n1/mydir/myfile
```

### 2.4.6 fallocate

- Description: This command is used to allocate a specified amount of storage space to a file. You can specify the offset of the file. After this command is successfully run, the size of the file may change. 
   - If the sum of the offset and the allocated storage space is less than or equal to the original size of the file, the size of the file remains unchanged. 
   - If the sum of the offset and the allocated storage space is greater than the original size of the file, the size of the file changes to the new file that you specify. 
- Options:
   - `-o`: (Optional) specifies the offset of the file. Default value: 0. 
   - `-l`: specifies the amount of storage space that you want to allocate to the file. 
- Examples:

```bash
# Allocate 100 bytes of storage space starting at an offset of 4 to the myfile file. After this command is successfully run, the size of the file changes to 104 bytes.
$sudo pfs -C disk fallocate -o 4 -l 100 /nvme1n1/mydir/myfile

$sudo pfs -C disk stat /nvme1n1/mydir/myfile
  file:/1/mydir/myfile
  size:104             blocks:8192
device: dev-20          inode:4103 links:1
